Exploring the degrees of freedom in the aperiodic monotile, following a suggestion of Jim Propp:

**Live demo:** https://timhutton.github.io/hat-freedom/

The hat monotile is made of short (blue) and long (red) vectors, here labelled by the position of the hour hand on a clock:

By changing the relative length of the vectors we can smoothly change from the 'hat' to the 'turtle'.

By rotating one of the clock faces in 3D we can get non-planar tiles.

While non-planar tiles are fun, sadly this breaks the monotile-ness - the tiles are now different shapes in 3D.
